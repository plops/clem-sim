  abstract = {We describe a method of obtaining optical sectioning with a standard
	wide-field fluorescence microscope. The method involves acquiring
	two images, one with nonuniform illumination (in our case, speckle)
	and another with uniform illumination (in our case, randomized speckle).
	An evaluation of the local contrast in the speckle-illumination image
	provides an optically sectioned image with low resolution. This is
	complemented with high-resolution information obtained from the uniform-illumination
	image. A fusion of both images leads to a full resolution image that
	is optically sectioned across all spatial frequencies. This hybrid
	illumination method is fast, robust, and generalizable to a variety
	of illumination and imaging configurations. (c) 2008 Optical Society
